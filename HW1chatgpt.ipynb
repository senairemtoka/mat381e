It gave me the answer: I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. It seems that I made an error in the code. The issue is that I tried to access the 'Open' and 'Close' columns directly from the 'data' DataFrame, but 'data' is a multi-index DataFrame containing Open, High, Low, Close, etc. for each stock. We should access the columns using multi-indexing. Let's correct that. Here's the revised code:\n",
