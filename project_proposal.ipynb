    "To be able to answer the questions that we are asking to the dataset; we are going to use a Natural Language Processing Library called NLTK. The Natural Language Toolkit is a python library to work with human language data. With this library we can process text by classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing and many more. We will also have to use the libraries matplotlib, seaborn for visualization and pandas for data manipulation like using the data as a dataframe etc. We also might use the scikit-learn library for clustering and for machine learning if we decide to do predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tokenizing is dividing a body of text into words or sentences. We will have to use this method for most of our dataset when analyzing the posts’ title, the post’s body text and tldr sections. This will get us started to analyze the data. Tokenizing by words will help us identify the words that come up often while tokenizing by sentences will give information about the words that relate to each other and help us see more context. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Classification is to assign text into pre-established groups or labels according to its content. We can apply it to our data such as topic categorization and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stopwords makes us filter the words that are frequently used but lack meaningful content like ‘in’, ‘is’, ‘the’. With this method we get rid of the clutter of words that we don’t really need in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stemming is the process of reducing words to their root, the core part of the word. For example, dancing and dancer will reduce to the root ‘dance’. Instead of focusing on every nuance of a word's usage, stemming enables us to focus on its essential meaning. However, we should be careful about understemming and overstemming to avoid false negatives and false positives by linking two unrelated words or not linking the related words. We can use Snowball Stemmer or Porter Stemmer in NLTK.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tagging parts of speech is categorizing the data such as verbs, nouns, adjectives etc and understanding its role in sentences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Lemmatization, which is similar to stemming, consists of breaking down words into their most basic or dictionary form (lemma). When producing words, it takes context into account (for example, \"worse\" becomes \"bad\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chunking is grouping adjacent words according to their parts of speech to extract meaningful chunks and phrases from the text. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Chinking is the opposite of chunking, it is to remove specific parts of a phrase or chunked text to eliminate patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Named entity recognition (NER) is to identify and classify the entities like the names of people, locations, organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating  a concordance includes listing occurrences of  certain words or phrases and providing the contexts for each circumstance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lexical Dispersion Plot is to have graphical representation to show the distribution of the words that we have across the data. This will help visualize the patterns and trends of words and their usage."
